<description>
Search in files (sif) is a small tool which is intended to search text in multiple files.
Search results are not only file name, line and column numbers,
but additionally the whole line from file.

Click on search result loads whole file into edit control with highlight
of found text.
Text could be edited and saved right there.

This tool understands cp1251 and utf-8 text encodings and
both CRLF and LF line endings.
It supports command line argument and path/file drag'n'drop.
It automatically creates shortcut in SendTo folder to simplify
its usage from windows explorer.

It works on Windows platform (XP, Vista, 7).
Also it should work on Windows 2000, Windows 8, Windows 10, but such cases
have not been tested yet.

This tool is written in C programming language with no "bold"
framework (MFC, .NET, ...) involved. Raw WinAPI only.
Due to this it has small size, it has no complex dependencies and thus it can work
without any installation procedures (other than simple exe-file copy).

No administrative priviledges are required.
