{"name":"SIF","tagline":"search text in files","body":"# Search In Files\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis small tool is intended to search text in multiple files.\r\nSearch results are not only file name, line and column numbers,\r\nbut additionally the whole line from file.\r\n\r\nClick on search result loads whole file into edit control with highlight\r\nof found text.\r\nText could be edited and saved right there.\r\n\r\nThis tool understands both cp1251 and utf-8 text encodings and\r\nboth CRLF and LF line endings.\r\nIt supports command line argument and path/file drag'n'drop.\r\nIt automatically creates shortcut in SendTo folder to simplify\r\nits usage from windows explorer.\r\n\r\nIt works on Windows platform (XP, Vista, 7).\r\nAlso it should work on Windows 2000 and Windows 8, but such case\r\nhas not been tested yet.\r\n\r\nThis tool is written in C programming language with no \"bold\"\r\nframework (MFC, .NET, ...) involved. Raw WinAPI only.\r\nDue to this it has small size, it has no complex dependencies and thus it can work\r\nwithout any installation procedures (other than simple exe-file copy).\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to build\r\n\r\n### Tools used\r\n\r\nTo build search in files utility used free gcc compiler for windows.\r\nI use Mingw-w64 distro for 32-bit platform\r\n(http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/). Path to its executables (*bin*\r\nsubdirectory) should be added to system *PATH* environment variable\r\nafter installation.\r\n\r\nCompiler version used:\r\n\r\n    gcc.EXE (i686-posix-dwarf-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 5.2.0\r\n\r\nMore direct link is -\r\n[HERE](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/5.2.0/threads-posix/dwarf/)\r\nor you can use their official installer.\r\n\r\nTo unpack downloaded file you may use free 7-zip archiver (http://7-zip.org).\r\n\r\nProgram can be built by *jam* build system:\r\n\r\n    FT Jam 2.5.2. OS=NT (http://www.freetype.org/jam/).\r\n\r\nIt's not necessary to use *jam* as a build system, but in case you will\r\nyou should also add path to *jam.exe* to system *PATH* environment variable.\r\n\r\n### Build program\r\n\r\nTo build program you should run batch file\r\n*build_all.bat* in project root.\r\n\r\nIn case of using *jam* build system you should run *jam* in project root\r\nor just execute batch file *1.bat* there which does exactly the same.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
